This is a set of scripts for building a structure that summarizes a data set.

This is under construction.  Outline of what this will do:

1. Read in data and associate a data type with each feature.
2. Create summary information that is specific to the feature type
	- if numeric - store histogram info
	- if integer - store histogram info?
	- if factor - store bar chart info
	- if boolean - store bar bar chart info
	- if date - make sure to parse data directly (work on this last) store histogram info
	- if string - will work on something
